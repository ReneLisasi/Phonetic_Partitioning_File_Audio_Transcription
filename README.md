# Phonetic_Partitioning_File_Audio_Transcription
Abstract: Speech to text is widely available and nothing new. The available tools to complete speech transcription from direct input (like a microphone) are good but fall short during audio file transcription (mp3/wav). The aim of this paper is to research and implement a novel audio transcription method that is hopefully more accurate, lightweight, faster, and requires less training than conventional speech to text models like CMU-Sphinx or Googleâ€™s Speech Recognition. This novel method employs cosine similarity to break down words into phonetic partitions that are compared to a lightweight dataset of formant vectors that correspond to a sound which has possible syntactic outcomes (letters). The result of this research is a relatively simpler, novel way to transcribe audio specifically designed to tackle file audio.
